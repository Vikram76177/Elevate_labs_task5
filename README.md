🧼 Data Cleaning Summary

✔ Missing values handled

Age → median

Embarked → mode

Cabin → removed (too many missing)

✔ Data type conversion

Sex → numeric mapping

Embarked → numeric mapping

✔ Dataset validation

Checked duplicates

Verified ranges & distributions

📊 Exploratory Data Analysis
🔹 Univariate Analysis

Passenger age distribution

Fare distribution

Survival count

Class distribution

🔹 Bivariate Analysis

Survival vs Gender

Survival vs Passenger Class

Survival vs Age

Fare differences by survival

🔹 Multivariate Analysis

Correlation heatmap

Pairplot (relationships between major features)

🔑 Key Insights & Findings

💡 Females survived at a significantly higher rate than males
💡 1st-class passengers had the best survival rate
💡 Higher fare = higher survival probability
💡 Younger passengers showed slightly better survival odds
💡 Strong negative correlation: Pclass ↔ Fare
